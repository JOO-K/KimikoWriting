            <p><span id="first-letter">T</span>he boy I nanny looks at me with the slightest mischief. The twinkle in his eye tells me a joke is
                coming. He says, “knock knock.” Entertaining what I assume to be one of his routine jokes, I ask
                who is there. He replies, stone cold and with zero reservation, “It’s your dad. He’s been gone for
                35 years and has finally returned with the milk.” He holds an imaginary microphone to my
                mouth, as if interviewing me, and states, “How does that make you feel.” Yet, his ending remark
                is not a question, as he holds no care for how I actually feel, but rather an ending statement that
                perfectly annotates the complexity of his joke. The past four years of not having my dad with me
                pass behind eyes like rolling film. He has no idea how he’s caught me, how good his joke
                actually is. It hurts to be burned by a nine year old.
                <br><br>
                In the past three months I have spent lengths of time with three different groups of children. All
                ranging from nine to fourteen years old. All living in different areas, of varying racial and
                economic backgrounds. Some with older siblings, some without. One family with an actively
                married couple, one divorced with shared custody and one widowed. Multi-gendered, racially
                diverse from one another, all of varying economical standings and from differing neighborhoods;
                two from completely different states. In each of these groups I have observed commonality
                within the children depicting ruthless behavior and emotionless positions. Frequently dealt out
                are jokes meant to sting, comments meant to chip away at another person’s self esteem.
                Unfortunately, no one is safe and everyone is left reeling from blows to their ego.
                <br><br>
                With Youtube, Twitch, Instagram and Tik Tok combined I am not sure there is anything in the
                world kids these days could not learn. Many individuals would argue that Tik Tok now has
                become a trusted outlet for their news source as it is unfiltered and internationally utilized.
                Coverage currently broadcasted from Palenstine now via Tik Tok has opened users’ eyes
                towards the possibility of another way in which social media can be utilized. The positive polarity
                of the induction of social media is resounding and has pushed the next generation to be smarter
                than we ever were. If every person is born into circumstance and the parameters of their
                circumstance are dictated by the rules that bind their environment into a cohesive structure then
                social media is the hammer that shatters their glass ceiling. Allowing this generation and then
                next greater capability to grow outside of their natural born environment.
                <br><br>
                From Tik Tok’s release in 2016 to becoming the most downloaded app in 2018 it is amazing that
                it came into fruition just before the Covid outbreak. With kids forced to stay at home and self
                entertain, Tik Tok quickly became an avenue in which children could still readily interact with one
                another. Suddenly, the interaction and social education children rely upon in school was
                replaced with education on social interaction through social media. Many adults spend hours on
                Tik Tok a day. We can all find entertainment in trending slang such as ‘big back’ and ‘Ohio,’ yet
                could it be that the things we consume and view as adults on Tik Tok are not registering as pure
                entertainment to children? Are they observing, learning and absorbing this material as a means
                of understanding how to interact and operate within the world? If children now view Tik Tok as a
                standard for interaction, is it perhaps difficult or maybe impossible for them to discern between
                pure entertainment and the do’s & don’ts of social interaction? Has this early age exposure
                mixed with the lack of social interaction created a uniquely different and wildly ruthless
                generation? How parents can find the energy, time and will to mitigate this, reduce their
                children’s exposure without subjecting them to social alienation and participation in their
                generation’s cultural wave is beyond me. Let us all hope that the positive polarity of this
                induction greatly outweighs the negative as the future of our world depends on it.</p>

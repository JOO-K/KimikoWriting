            <p><span id="first-letter">O</span>n my daily walk around the block of my neighborhood I feel the pressure of my
                thoughts against the skull that holds my mind. When stuck inside writing I feel pushed to
                the brink of insanity and find a sense of relief in spending some moments in the nature
                that surrounds my home.
                <br><br>
                Its normalcy, suburban bliss, like a tether, brings me back down to earth. As if the
                simplicity of life here invokes a resounding sense of calmness that reigns in my
                existential thoughts. My neighborhood, albeit quiet, seems to still always be bustling.
                Groups of chatty schoolgirls walk home with one another. Their laughter and joy brings
                a sense of life into the streets of my neighborhood that I find refreshing. Couples and
                friends join one another in strolls, often with animal companions in stride. At times it
                feels as though my walk is an observation of individuals partaking in communion with
                one another rather than a mission to exercise the body and release the mind.
                <br><br>
                At one point during my walk, the voice of a past love rolls into my mind. Her voice, in a
                whisper, conveys that she could never live in an area so domestic. Her words meet my
                ears yet again and just as they did when she first spoke them, they strike me as odd.
                What is so bad about living in the suburbs anyways?
                
                I don’t entertain the thought for long as something out of place catches my eye mid
                stroll. I stop, caught in my tracks, and stare down at the bush below me. At knee level is
                a book, perfectly vacuum sealed in plastic, resting atop the leaves. It looks pristine, held
                almost as a gift, reaching up towards me. I am tempted to peek into the book without
                any commitment towards keeping it, but the plastic protecting it prevents me from doing
                just that.
                <br><br>
                The words speak out to me clearly: ‘Authoring Autism / on rhetoric and neurological
                queerness.’ I had never thought of Autism, let alone its ideas pertaining to rhetoric and
                neurological queerness. Committed now, spurred by curiosity, I pick up my new book
                and rip off the plastic, a divine feeling flowing.
                <br><br>
                Shocked by its contents and shamed by such truth that I soon realize the book itself
                portrays ideologies and concerns that not only had I never considered, but relayed
                truths that overlapped to every other minority group I had studied at university. Of
                course, autistic people would feel this way, but how had I never considered them? How
                had I never considered how their truths could teach me lessons, not only of their own
                community, but of my own?
                <br><br>
                The more I read the more I began to understand that it is much easier to dehumanize
                those with traits that threaten prosocial norms than it is to make room, adjust for and
                
                empathize with those individuals. To be exclusive not only evokes a sense of power
                over others, but it is much easier than the practice of inclusion.
                <br><br>
                Melanie Yergeau, author of Authoring Autism, not only depicts the struggles many
                autistic persons face when kept in the shadows but additionally relays a vulnerable truth
                that her own experience with autism has left her with moments of uncontrollable bodily
                movements, being spoken for as opposed to spoken with and exiled. Yergeau’s divine
                evocation of feeling, thought and truth proves as a direct opposition to countless
                preconceived notions surrounding autism.
                <br><br>
                In its most simple form, Yergeau’s sentiments convey a feeling that resides in all of us.
                A feeling of being deeply misunderstood, fear of rejection and exclusion, to not only feel
                out of control of the body, but to be a slave to its whims. To feel alone and to be left
                alone intentionally is a feeling I hope we can all spare one another. Residing in each of
                us is the power to include, to bring one another closer together through understanding
                and maybe in doing so we will reach another level of heightened thought and
                enlightened perspective.
